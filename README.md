# Concrete-case-study
with gradient boosting, linear regression, cross validation

1. Built base line linear regression model

2. Implemented Transformer

3. Impelmeneted pipeline

4. implemented RFE

5. Implemented Polynomial Transformer

6. Check for LASSO &, Ridge

7. Implemeneted Gradient Boosting Regressor and also hypertuned it.

8. Last but not least implemented Cross Validation
